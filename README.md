# Gesture Particles System

Interactive real-time particle visuals driven by hand gestures in your browser.

## Overview

This project renders a dynamic particle system that reacts to hand gestures detected from your webcam. Each gesture triggers a unique particle shape or behavior (such as Saturn, heart, or sphere). The system is built for creative interaction and real-time visual feedback.
